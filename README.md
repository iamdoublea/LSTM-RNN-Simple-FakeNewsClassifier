# LSTM-RNN-Simple-FakeNewsClassifier
This is a straightforward Fake News Detector NLP Project.

We have used the LSTM RNN to create the model and created metrics like Accuracy to measure the performance

(Note: All kinds of Hyperparameter tunings are avoided because of system constrain)

Now, here I took a dataset from Kaggle and used it to train an LSTM RNN to created network of neurons with 100 neurons and a vector feature dimension of 40.

The steps taken here are
1) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - Using Stopwords and Stemming 
2) Encoding Data - Using One-Hot Encoding
3) Padding Data
4) Creating and Training Model
5) Train Test Split
6) Fitting Model 
7) Model Performance Evaluation
